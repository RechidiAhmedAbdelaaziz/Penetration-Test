Identifying employees on social media (e.g., [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Xing](https://www.xing.de)) and analyzing job posts can reveal:

- Technologies, programming languages, and frameworks in use
- Infrastructure details (databases, version control, CI/CD, etc.)
- Employee skills and focus areas

## Example Job Post Insights

## Employee Profiles

- Skills and open-source contributions often listed
- Shared projects may expose sensitive info (e.g., emails, hardcoded JWTs)
- Security misconfigurations can be researched (see [Django OWASP Top10](https://github.com/boomcamp/django-security))

## LinkedIn Search Tips

- Filter by role, skills, company, location, etc.
- Focus on technical and security staff to infer infrastructure and security measures

**Summary:**  
Social media and job posts are valuable for infrastructure enumeration. Analyze employee profiles and shared projects for clues about technologies and potential security gaps.
